## Introduction
In the investment area, volume is one of the important indicators affecting stocks prices. For investors who lack experience, how to choose target stocks is a difficult topic.
The first ETF which used the NLP technique to builds its index was launched this year. It looks like more and more people apply the news and social media data in the financial area. Social media discussions become one of the risks that affect stock prices.

Buzz ETF invests in the top 75 firms of the largest U.S. stock with highest discussions volume on social media. 
Since only the U.S. stocks on the shortlist, we also wanna know would it be possible to issue in Taiwan.
so we decided to use the concept of the Buzz ETF, build an index by using the stocks in the TW market.
